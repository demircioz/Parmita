> ⚠️ **Important Note**  
> ℹ️ For now, only the **chocolate mousse recipe** is fully functional.  
> Due to time constraints, we were not able to integrate or make the other recipes functional yet.  
> This project is therefore currently a **static website** with only one complete and working recipe.


We first defined the objectives of our project: to create a **clear, modern, and responsive recipe website**, adapted to all devices.
To do this, we listed the essential elements to display, such as the dish image, ingredients, preparation steps, as well as user ratings and reviews.
Then, we sketched several mock-ups by hand to think about the overall layout, and later reproduced them on **Figma** to achieve a more professional result.

At the same time, part of the group started coding the basic HTML structure to save time and prepare for integration.
After several discussions, we validated a simple and readable visual identity, with visual icons (stars, clock, etc.) to enhance the user experience.
We also designed the website to be fully **responsive**, so that it automatically adapts to different screens (computer, tablet, mobile).

Finally, we harmonized everything with a consistent header and footer, inspired by the recipe website, by removing unnecessary redirects and keeping only the essentials: contact, legal notices, social networks and newsletter.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design a **modern, intuitive and responsive recipe website**.
It allows users to:

* View ingredients and preparation steps,
* Read reviews,
* Browse popular and recent recipes.

The project also highlights the importance of **UI/UX design** through visual mock-ups and responsive code (adapted for computers, tablets and mobile devices).

## 🖼️ Mock-ups

We created several mock-ups in order to plan the display on different devices (desktop and mobile).
This was the subject of many discussions.
We debated colors, layout and element sizes.
Through iterative user testing (tested by Jimmy), we progressively improved the interface.

### Home Page / Recipe List

* Recipes are displayed as cards with the **dish image**, **title**, **preparation time**, and **average rating**.
* A clear and repetitive layout allows for a **fast and intuitive user journey**.

### Detailed Recipe Page

* **Photo or video** of the dish at the top of the page.
* **List of ingredients** (clear and well-organized).
* **Numbered preparation steps**.
* A **user reviews and ratings** section to encourage interaction.
* Highlighting of the **preparation time** with a clock icon.

### Responsive Design (Mobile)

* Simplified navigation with a **burger menu**.
* Recipe cards adapted to the screen width.
* Column-based organization for smoother reading.
* Footer kept with access to social networks and the newsletter.

These choices guarantee a consistent user experience across all platforms.

## 💻 Technical Choices & Code

* **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript** as the technical foundation of the project.
* Use of **Flexbox and CSS Grid** to structure sections and ensure responsiveness.
* **Icons (clock, stars)** for a more visual and intuitive interface.
* A common **footer** on all pages including:

  * Contact links,
  * Legal notices,
  * Newsletter subscription,
  * Social networks (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok).

## Development Principles

### 1. Responsiveness

* Use of media queries to adapt the layout.
* Burger menu on mobile.
* Image resizing and adaptation.

### 2. Accessibility

* High contrast and readable text.
* Semantic HTML structure.

### 3. Reusability

* Modular components (reusable recipe cards, common header and footer reused from previous Web project).
